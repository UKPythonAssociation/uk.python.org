# uk.python.org

This is the main web presence for the UK Python Association.

The idea is that this is relatively small and self contained static site containing core information.
Extra/dynamic functionality we might want to offer - event listings, community pages etc. - should live in other codebases on subdomains,
to keep the main site light and straightforward.

## Operational Information

Kristian Glass / @doismellburning maintains this site.

The live instance is hosted on Netlify at https://pedantic-hoover-d96269.netlify.com/ and auto-deploys from `master` with GitHub hooks.

This replaced https://github.com/PyconUK/community.uk.python.org which now lives at https://community.uk.python.org/
